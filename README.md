# BigNumberCalculator

Ruby has build-in bignumber calculator as described at: 
Bignum handle: https://sites.google.com/site/gyakuhikiruby/home/shu-zhi

I wrote Bignumber class to implement bignumbers PLUS and MULTIPLE for Ruby without using Ruby build-in bignumber.

## PLUS
Use naive algorithm

## MULTIPLE
Use `Karatsuba` algorithm from
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer-set-2-karatsuba-algorithm-for-fast-multiplication/

## TODO
Optimize code
